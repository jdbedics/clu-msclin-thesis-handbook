# The MS Clinical Psychology Handbook

The goal of this handbook is to provide students with the information needed to successfully complete the master's thesis in MS in Clinical Psychology Program (MSCP) at California Lutheran University.  The manual should be understood as a supplement to the broader policies and procedures defined by the program and university.
