# Goal of the Handbook

The goal of this handbook is to provide students with the information needed to successfully complete the master's thesis in the MS in Clinical Psychology Program (MSCP) at California Lutheran University (CLU).  The manual should be understood as a supplement to the broader policies and procedures defined by the program and university. 


## Comprehensive Exams or Thesis?

Upon enrolling the MSCP program, students are expected to complete the comprehensive exam in order to complete the degree.  Students can, however, choose to complete a thesis project which would replace the the comprehensive exam option.

**What is the comprehensive exam?**: The comprehensive exam is a closed book/note essay test that covers all the material studied during the course of the MSCP program.  The test is offered at the end of the spring semester during the second year. The exam consists of a morning session (9AM-Noon) and an afternoon session (1PM-4PM).  During each session, students choose to respond to 3 of 5 essay style questions.  

Choosing the comprehensive exam results in 3 less credit hours for the completion of the program for a total of 37-units. Instead, in their final semester students pay a comprehensive exam fee. In addition, students taking the comprehensive exams can choose to take PSYC 565 Research Practicum in the fall of their second year or, instead, take an extra elective with Dr. Bedics' approval. 

## Thesis Project

Students who choose to work on a thesis must follow the procedures and guidelines in this manual in order to stay in the thesis track.  Students who fail to follow any of these steps will be moved back to the comprehensive exam option.  Students can, however, continue to work on their research project as an _independent project_ and not for partial fulfillment of the requirements of the program (i.e., credit).

Students choosing the thesis must enroll in PSYC 565 and PSYC 566 during the fall and spring semester of their second year, respectively. PSYC 565 can, however, be taken if students are choosing to complete an independent research project and would like structured faculty assistance.  The completion of 566 for 3-units results in a total of 40-units for the completion of the degree. 

**Bottom line**: The main benefit of the thesis project is that it provides students with the opportunity to conduct their own independent research project with the support of faculty.  Whether you choose to do this as a _thesis_ or an _independent project_, in reality, matters little to future doctoral program.  Instead, future advisors will be looking at the *quality* of work regardless of the status of the project.
