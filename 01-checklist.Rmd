## Thesis Topic Selection

___

**Defining the Problem Area**

The general thesis topic is required to be selected during the beginning of the first semester of the first year.  The thesis topic, does not, however, determine the hypotheses, methodology or general approach taken by the student to understand the problem (e.g. experimental, quasi-experimental, meta-analytic methods). It would be premature for any student to attempt to define a hypothesis in the first year when their understanding of the topic area is limited and not justified by a thorough literature review.  Hypotheses are typically developed after the first year of study when the student has a better grasp of the problem to be solved (see the Wampold article in [Section 10 References](#resources) for a guide on hypothesis development). 

___


***Tips for finding a Topic***

Students are often unnecessarily delayed in choosing an area to study which could impact the success of the thesis.  In choosing a topic students should keep a few points in mind:
  
  1. It certainly is helpful if you are **passionate** about the topic.  When a person is passionate about a topic they naturally want to read about and understand the area under study.  They often go to bed thinking about the topic and will wake up excited and thinking about what they will do next in relation to their project. It can be a very exciting time because you're working on something you love and have fun doing.
  
  2. **Reflect on your interests.** It's okay if you are not particularly passionate about any specific area of study. Passion often starts by first examining an area of **interest** with some degree of focus, commitment, and consistency. If you have areas of interest then the next step is to simply select one area, commit to it, and start reading and writing. Passion often comes *after* we put the work in. 
  
  3. **Select *one* interest. Don't flip-flop.**  The problem is that we all have multiple interests.  For example, you might really like schizophrenia but at the same time you're really interested in forensic psychology and the prison system.  One semester you might want to study psychosis and the next semester you might become more interested in the prison system. Students can "flip flop" for a variety of reasons which can have two unfortunate consequences. First, you never get anything done.  When you don't get anything done then it's hard to feel good about yourself and you also make no progress.  Second, continued indecisiveness could implicitly instill in the student a sense that they should always feel comfortable with their topic, that work on the thesis should always be easy and interesting, or that they might be "missing out" by not researching some other area of interest.  In reality, none of these are true. One of the greatest challenges of doing research is developing the ability to consistently make small steps on a project even when the feeling is not there or other demands are present and taking up our time. It is likely that your lifestyle and habits will change when you are dedicated to research.  You will simply be working more (much, much, more) and have less leisure time.  
  
  4. **The thesis will not define you.**  Students should understand that the topic they select to study will not define their career.  In this sense, the thesis topic itself is not really that important. What is more important is that students pick a topic so they can learn *how* to do competent research. You can't learn how to do competent research if you don't have a focused topic. In sum, it would be nice if you are passionate or, at minimum, interested in the topic but it simply is not ***necessary*** in order to complete a thesis and learn how to conduct good research.
  
  5. **Find an article that excites you.**  One way to find a topic is to choose an area of interest and read as many research articles in the subject that you can find.  In doing so, it will be easiest for your to restrict your reading to the introduction and discussion sections only.  Diving into the method and results sections can sometimes be overwhelming and demoralizing.  Once you find an article that excites you then can consider the method and results sections.  A second important point here is that good science should include **replication**.  An excellent thesis would be a proposed replication of the study that was found to be interesting.  The model for the thesis (e.g., lit. reviewed, method, data analysis) can be the published paper.  In the past, students in the MSCP program have taken this approach with considerable success and have even had the authors on those papers act as committee members.

## Open Science Framework

**Creating a transparent and reproducible workflow**

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/osf.png")
```


[OSF](https://accounts.osf.io/login?campaign=institution&service=https%3A%2F%2Fosf.io%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fosf.io%252F) is a repository that allows researchers to transparently share their work with the larger scientific community. During the course of the program, students use OSF to organize their thesis and other independent research projects.  Instructions for setting up an OSF project can be found [here](https://speakerdeck.com/jdbedics/osf-setup-and-class-project-introduction) and will be reviewed with Dr. Bedics during students first advising meeting. 

In addition to organizing students' workflow, OSF allows students to showcase their work to their peers and potential employers and doctoral advisors.  Students in the thesis option are required to use OSF by logging in through the [CLU SSO](https://accounts.osf.io/login?campaign=institution&service=https%3A%2F%2Fosf.io%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fosf.io%252F) and it is strongly recommended for students completing the research project. 

**Due**: October 1st, first year.

## Committee Assignment

___

Committee members are faculty or experts in the field that support the students work on the thesis. Students work with the program director to find the most appropriate committee members to support their research project.  The committee is composed of a Chair and a Reader.  Their roles are described below as is the process for finding and selecting committee members. 

___

**Committee Chair**

The chair must have *content knowledge* of the area under investigation for the thesis. For example, if the thesis is on schizophrenia then the chair must have extensive knowledge of schizophrenia. The chair is either a part-time or full-time faculty member at CLU and is chosen with the approval of the Program Director, Dr. Bedics.  There can be exceptions to the above criteria with the approval of Dr. Bedics. 

**Committee Reader**

The reader must have either content knowledge or expert *methodological knowledge* of the area under investigation for the thesis. For example, if the thesis is on schizophrenia and utilizes an experimental design then the reader can either have knowledge of schizophrenia **or** knowledge of the experimental methods proposed.  The reader can be a part-time or full-time faculty member at CLU or a professional in the community with at least a Masterâ€™s degree that has the aforementioned expertise. The reader must be chosen with approval of Program Director and thesis Committee Chair. There can be exceptions to the above criteria with the approval of the Program Director. 

___

### Finding a Committee

For many faculty, being on a thesis committee is a lot of work and they are often reluctant to agree to help students. Consequently, how students choose to approach faculty is very critical. Please consider these guidelines and talk to Dr. Bedics prior to reaching out to potential committee members.   

___

**1. Identifying Potential Faculty**

Search the CLU website for potential faculty that could contribute to your idea.  Look at faculty interests in graduate psychology, undergraduate psychology, as well as other departments at CLU.  Students could also identify faculty at other universities that might serve on the committee.  Once identified, students should email Dr. Bedics to discuss.

___

**2.	Foot-in-the-Door** 

Students first introduce themselves to faculty through email.  **Do not ask them to join your committee** in the first email.  Instead, ask them if they have time to answer questions about your project. If they don't have time or incentive to do this then they will not be willing to be on your committee. The foot-in-the-door strategy also allows students to get feedback from the person even if they are not willing to be on students' committee.  

Here is a properly formatted and professional email using the foot-in-the-door strategy:


_Dear Dr. ###,_

_My name is <STUDENT> and I am currently developing my masterâ€™s thesis project at California Lutheran University in the MS Clinical Psychology Program.  The topic is <TOPIC>. I think your expertise in <AREA> would help me in thinking through some of the details of the thesis.  I was curious if you could make time to answer a few questions over email or perhaps even chat over the phone or during your office hours?  I have attached a brief summary of my project._

_Thank you for your time and consideration._

_Sincerely,_

_First Name Last Name_


If they reply, and are positive, then you it is your responsibility to be flexible with *your* time.  Also, please never ask for an appointment in the same week.  

___

**3.	Requesting Committee Membership** â€“ If the initial meeting goes well then Dr. Bedics will email the faculty member to discuss the role of the Chair and Reader.  

___

**4. Working with your committee**

The committee will be most successful when students establish clear expectations for meeting with their committee members.  Clearly established expectations will prevent students from emailing *too little* or *too much*.  It is best to suggest *fewer* meetings at first, perhaps one at the beginning and one at the end of the semester. You will have more meetings with your chair than your reader.  Establish the following:
  
  * Make a clear statement that you are respectful of their time and do not want to meet too much or too little.  Faculty often appreciate such direct and respectful statements. 
  
  * Suggest two meetings a semester and go from there.  They might suggest more or a timeline based upon other criteria.

___

 
**Due**: June 30th, Summer after First Year

___

## Committee Approval of Proposal

___

During the Summer Semester following the first year, committee members read the literature review and method section and provide a general statement of approval to Dr. Bedics.  Based upon this approval, students are allowed to progress to the **thesis track** and enroll in _PSYC 565 Research Practicum_ in the Fall of the second year and _PSYC 566 Thesis_ in the Spring of the second year. 

**Due**: September 1st, Second Year

___

## Academic Good Standing

___

Academic good standing refers to maintaining a GPA above a 3.0 throughout the entire program and acting consistently with all policies and procedures defined by the program and university.  Any student who receives below a B- in any course, at anytime in the program, is not allowed to complete the thesis for course credit and partial fulfillment of the degree and will be required to take the comprehensive exam. They can, however, complete a research project with the support of full-time faculty. 

**Due**: Every semester
