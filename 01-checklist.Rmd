## Thesis Topic Selection

___

**Defining the Problem Area**

The general thesis topic is required to be selected during the beginning of the first semester of the first year.  The thesis topic, does not, however, determine the hypotheses, methodology or general approach taken by the student to understand the problem (e.g. experimental, quasi-experimental, meta-analytic methods). It would be premature for any student to attempt to define a hypothesis in the first year when their understanding of the topic area is limited and not justified by a thorough literature review.  Hypotheses are typically developed after the first year of study when the student has a better grasp of the problem to be solved (see the Wampold article in [Section 10 References](#resources) for a guide on hypothesis development). 

___


***Tips for finding a Topic***

Students are often unnecessarily delayed in choosing a broad area to study which can impact the success of the thesis.  In choosing a topic students should keep a few points in mind:
  
  1. It certainly is helpful if you are **passionate** about the topic.  When a person is passionate  about a topic they naturally want to read about and understand the area under study.  They often go to bed thinking about the topic and will wake up excited and thinking about what they will do that day related to their project. It can be a very exciting time because you're working on something you love and have fun doing.
  
  2. **Reflect on your interests.** It's okay if you are not particularly passionate about any specific area of study. Passion often starts by first examining an area of **interest** with some degree of focus, commitment, and consistency. If you have an area of interest then the next step is to simply select one area, commit to it, and start reading and writing. Passion often comes *after* we put the work in. 
  
  3. **Select *one* interest. Don't flip-flop.**  The problem is that we all have multiple interests.  For example, you might really like schizophrenia but at the same time you're really interested in forensic psychology and the prison system.  One semester you might want to study psychosis and the next semester you might become more interested in the prison system. Students can "flip flop" for a variety of reasons which can have two unfortunate consequences. First, you never get anything done.  When you don't get anything done then it's hard to feel good about yourself and you make no progress.  Second, continued indecisiveness could implicitly instill in the student a sense that they should always feel comfortable with their topic, that work on the thesis should always be easy and interesting, or that they might be "missing out" by not researching some other area of interest.  In reality, none of these are true. One of the greatest challenges of doing research is developing the ability to consistently make small steps on a project even when the feeling is not there or other demands are present and taking up our time. It is likely that you're lifestyle and habits will change when dedicated to research.  You just work more (much, much, more).  
  
  4. **The thesis will not define you.**  Students should understand that the topic they select to study will not define their career.  In this sense, the thesis topic itself is not really that important. What is more important is that students pick a topic so they can learn *how* to do competent research. You can't do that if you don't have a focused topic. In sum, it would be nice if you are passionate or, at minimum, interested in the topic but it simply is not ***necessary***. 
  
  5. **Find an article that excites you.**  One way to find a topic is to choose an area of interest and read as many research articles in the subject that you can.  In doing so, it will be easiest to read the introduction and discussion sections only.  Diving into the method and results can sometimes be overwhelming and demoralizing.  Once a student finds an article that excites them, they can consider the method and results section.  A second important point here is that good science should include **replication**.  An excellent thesis would be a replication study to see if the effects reported in prior work can be found again.  We do not often do this in psychological science and our field suffers because of it. 
  
**Due**: October 1st, first year.

## Open Science Framework

**Creating a transparent and reproducible workflow**

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/osf.png")
```


[OSF](https://accounts.osf.io/login?campaign=institution&service=https%3A%2F%2Fosf.io%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fosf.io%252F) is a repository that allows researchers to transparently share their work with the larger scientific community. During the course of the program, students use OSF to organize their thesis and other independent research projects.  Instructions for setting up an OSF project can be found [here](https://speakerdeck.com/jdbedics/osf-setup-and-class-project-introduction) and will be reviewed with Dr. Bedics at students first advising meeting. 

In addition to organizing students' workflow, OSF allows students to showcase their work to their peers and potential employers and doctoral advisors.  Students in the thesis option are required to use OSF by logging in through the [CLU SSO](https://accounts.osf.io/login?campaign=institution&service=https%3A%2F%2Fosf.io%2Flogin%2F%3Fnext%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fosf.io%252F) and it is strongly recommended for students completing the research project. 

**Due**: October 1st, first year.

## Literature Review Timeline

___

**Understanding the Problem**

The development of the literature review begins during the fall of the first year during PSYC 564 Advanced Research Methods.  The literature review will become the "introduction" section of the final thesis paper.  The literature review demonstrates the student's mastery of the literature surrounding the *problem* to be addressed by the thesis.  Initial drafts, such as that from PSYC 564, are 10-12 pages in length.  

The development of the literature review is, however, ongoing throughout the two years of the program until the final draft is submitted on May 1st of the second year. The typical length of a *completed* introduction section is between **20-40 pages** long but there is no maximum length. 

In terms of content, students are encouraged to consider multiple perspectives in their work and also to integrate their thoughts related to culture and diversity regarding the topic area.  The idea here is that a good understanding of a problem area involves a thorough understanding of the context.  Context includes a consideration of the place, time, and people under study as well as the same characteristics of those who are doing the investigating.  

**Due**: 
  
  1. December 15th, first year (First Major Draft);
  2. May 15th, end of first year (Second Major Draft with Hypotheses); 
  3. May 1st, end of second year (Final Draft).

___


## Method Section Timeline

___

**Solving the Problem**

The method sections defines the procedures of the thesis. The method section consists of the participant selection, selection of methods of measurements or materials, the procedure and the data analytic method. The method section can be worked on in *PSYC 552 Psychometrics* during spring of the first year and also *PSYC 562 Statistics II: Regression.*  The method section is finalized during *PSYC 565 Research Practicum* in the fall of the second year.

Lastly, the method section should include a **power analysis.**  The primary purpose of the power analysis is to provide students with the best understanding of the size of the sample needed to successfully test their hypothesis.   In other words, students should never have to say in their discussion "The study was limited due to a small sample.  Future research should include a larger sample size."  When authors make this statement they are basically stating that they ran a study where they can't lose.  If they find significance then great.  If they don't then they say "Oh well, we're probably right but just need more people."  You should ask yourself,  why would you run a test when you couldn't reach a conclusion and when you basically say you "win" regardless. It makes no sense to run the study. 

The power analysis should be calculated during the summer or during PSYC 565 in the fall of the second year and prior to IRB submission. 

**Video Resources:**

3. An article on the topic can found in [10 Resources](#resources).

**Due**: 

  1. May 1st, first year (First Draft);
  2. December 15th, second year (Second Draft including power analysis)

## Committee Assignment

___

Committee members are faculty or experts in the field that support the students work on the thesis. Students work with the program director to find the most appropriate committee members to support their research project.  The committee is composed of a Chair and a Reader.  Their roles are described below as is the process for finding and selecting committee members. 

___

**Committee Chair**

The chair must have *content knowledge* of the area under investigation for the thesis. For example, if the thesis is on schizophrenia then the chair must have extensive knowledge of schizophrenia. The chair is either a part-time or full-time faculty member at CLU and is chosen with the approval of the Program Director, Dr. Bedics.  There can be exceptions to the above criteria with the approval of Dr. Bedics. 

**Committee Reader**

The reader must have either content knowledge or expert *methodological knowledge* of the area under investigation for the thesis. For example, if the thesis is on schizophrenia and utilizes an experimental design then the reader can either have knowledge of schizophrenia **or** knowledge of the experimental methods proposed.  The reader can be a part-time or full-time faculty member at CLU or a professional in the community with at least a Master’s degree that has the aforementioned expertise. The reader must be chosen with approval of Program Director and thesis Committee Chair. There can be exceptions to the above criteria with the approval of Dr. Bedics. 

___

Please see [Section 4 Thesis Committee](#people) of this handbook for information on how to acquire a committee. 
  
**Due**: June 30th, Summer after First Year

___

## Committee Approval of Proposal

___

During the summer following the first year, committee members read the literature review and method section and provide a general statement of approval to Dr. Bedics.  Based upon this approval, students are allowed to progress to the **thesis track** and enroll in PSYC 565 Research Practicum in the fall of the second year and PSYC 566 Thesis in the spring of the second year. 

**Due**: September 1st, Second Year

___

## Academic Good Standing

___

Academic good standing refers to maintaining a GPA above a 3.0 throughout the entire program and acting consistently with all policies and procedures defined by the program (see Program Handbook) and university (see university policy and procedures).  Any student who receives below a B- in any course, at anytime in the program, is not allowed to complete the thesis for course credit and partial fulfillment of the degree. They can, however, complete a research project with the support of full-time faculty. 

**Due**: Every semester
