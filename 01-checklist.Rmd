# Thesis Checklist


Instruction: Students who wish to pursue the thesis option are required to meet with the Dr. Bedics at the end of every semester to review the required material for that semester.  Students who miss any of the following steps will be automatically removed from the thesis option and required to complete the comprehensive exam.  The student can, however, complete a research project but not for the partial fulfillment of the degree (i.e., credit).

Several, but not all, of the above tasks are detailed more fully in the following sections.


## Thesis Topic Approval - "Defining the Problem Area" (#1)

The general thesis topic is required to be selected during the beginning of the first semester of the first year.  The thesis topic, does not, however, determine the hypotheses, methodology or general approach taken by the student to understand the problem (e.g. experimental, quasi-experimental, meta-analytic methods). 

## Literature Review - "Understanding the Problem" (#2, #5)

The development of the literature review on the selected topic begins during the fall of the first during PSYC 564 Advanced Research Methods.  The literature review will become the "introduction" section of the final thesis project.  The literature review shows the student's mastery of the literature.  More importantly, the literature review shows the students understanding of the *problem* to be addressed and answered by the methodology.  The literature is to be worked on throughout the duration of the program.  

## Method Section - "Solving the Problem" (#4)

The method sections defines the procedures of the thesis project. The method section consists of the participant selection, selection of methods of measurements or materials, and the procedure.  The method section can be worked on in PSYC 552 Psychometrics during spring of the first 

## Committee Assignment (#7)

Committee members are faculty or experts in the field that support the students work on the thesis. Students work with the program director to find the most appropriate committee members to support their research project.  

  * Students select *2* committee members including a chair and a reader
  * One committee member must be affiliated with CLU; the second committee member can be from CLU or another institution
  * Committee members typically hold doctoral degrees in areas that support the students research
  * Students typically select a committee member who has domain expertise (often the chair) and one that has methodology expertise (reader).  
  * All committee members are approved by Dr. Bedics. 

## Committee Approval of Proposal (#10)

During the summer following the first year, committee members read the literature review and method section and provide a general statement of approval to Dr. Bedics.  Based upon this approval, students are allowed to progress to the *thesis track.*  The rest of the thesis process is guided through coursework including PSYC 565 Research Practicum in the fall of the second year and PSYC 566 Thesis in the spring of the second year. 

## Academic Good Standing (#12)

Academic good standing refers to maintaining a GPA above a 3.0 throughout the entire program and acting consistently with all policies and procedures defined by the program (see Program Handbook) and university (see university policy and procedures).  Any student who receives below a B- in any course is not allowed to complete the thesis for course credit and partial fulfillment of the degree.
