# Thesis Checklist


Instruction: Students are required to meet with the Dr. Bedics at the end of every semester to review the required material for that semester.  Students who miss any step will be automatically removed from the thesis option and required to complete the comprehensive exam.  The student can, however, complete a research project but not for the partial fulfillment of the degree (i.e., credit).  Missing any of the above steps will move the student back to the comprehensive exam option.
