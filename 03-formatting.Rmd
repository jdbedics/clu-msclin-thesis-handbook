 The thesis paper is completed in a manner consistent with the [Publication Manual of the APA (7th Edition)](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=apa+publication+manual+7th+edition&crid=7T10VJ2PYQZH&sprefix=apa+pu%2Caps%2C261&ref=nb_sb_ss_i_1_6). Specifically, the following sections should follow, exactly, the guidelines defined by the 7th Edition:

  * Abstract
  * Introduction
  * Method
  * Results
  * Discussion
  * References
  * Tables
  * Figures
  * Appendices
  
There are several sections that **do not** follow the 7th Edition of the Publication Manual:

  * Title Page
  * Table of Contents

For examples of these, please see the Thesis Materials section of the MSCP homepage in Blackboard.
