## Title Page

This page provides the name of the thesis project, names of the university and school or department, and date of completion. The title page should be prepared in accordance with the sample page found in this section. The date at the bottom of the page is the month and year the degree is awarded. The title page is unnumbered but is counted as page “i.”

## Signature Page

This page provides the name of the author and blank lines for the signatures of the committee members, Program Director, and the Graduate Dean. The pages are signed when the committee members and Program Director determine that the thesis is complete. It should bear original signatures for all copies (typically three). The date at the bottom of the page is the date the degree is awarded; however, the page is not counted in the numbering system.

___

## Abstract (APA style)

The abstract follows APA style and is typically completed in the Spring Semester of the second year.  A draft of the abstract, without results and without concluding statements, might be drafted during *PSYC 565 Research Practicum* during the of the second year. 

___


## Introduction (APA style)

**Understanding the Problem**

The development of the literature review begins during the Fall Semester of the first year during PSYC 564 Advanced Research Methods.  The literature review will become the "introduction" section of the final thesis paper.  The literature review demonstrates the student's mastery of the literature surrounding the *problem* to be addressed by the thesis.  Initial drafts, such as that from PSYC 564, are 10-12 pages in length.  

The development of the literature review is, however, ongoing throughout the two-years of the program until the final draft is submitted on May 1st of the second year. The typical length of a *completed* introduction section is maximum **10 pages** long although exceptions can be made to go over the maximum. 

In terms of content, students are encouraged to consider multiple perspectives in their work and also to integrate their thoughts related to culture and diversity regarding the topic area.  The idea here is that a good understanding of a problem area involves a thorough understanding of the context.  Context includes a consideration of the place, time, and people under study as well as the same characteristics of those who are doing the investigating.  

**Due**: 
  
  1. PSYC 564 Literature Review (December 15th of First Year)
  2. Summer Revision of Literature Review (May 15th of First Year)  
  3. PSYC 565 First Draft of Proposal (December 15th of Second Year)
  3. PSYC 566 Final Draft to Committee and Program Director (May 1st)
  
___


## Method (APA style)


**Due**: 

  1. PSYC 565 First Draft (Dec 15th)
  2. PSYC 566 Final Draft (May 1st)

___

## Results (APA style)

The results are typically drafted during the Spring Semester of the second year.  *PSYC 566 Thesis* is an independent study course.  There are no class meetings.  Instead, students meet with their thesis chair to review and write their analyses in the results section. 

The results section should be organized by study hypotheses.

___


## Discussion (APA style)

The discussion is a critical section of the research paper and is typically **10-pages** minimum.  In the discussion the student provide the following:

  * A summary of the proposed hypotheses and rationale.
  * A review of the results in narrative form without the presentation of any statistics.
  * A discussion of the implications of the results for each hypothesis. 
  * A discussion of future steps for each hypothesis.
  * A discussion of the limitations of the study in addressing each hypothesis.
  * Similar to the introduction, please consider culture and diversity in your discussion of the findings. 

The discussion section demonstrates the student's ability to place their study in the context of the larger literature and think more philosophically.  It is a space for creativity and ingenuity.  
  
___


## References (APA style)

References follow APA style.  Please make sure:

1. All citations _in text_ are in the _reference section_
2. All citations in the _reference section_ are cited _in text_.

___


## Tables, Figures, & Appendices (APA style)

Tables and Figures can be essential for helping a reader understand your data analysis and conclusions. Please follow APA formatting for all Tables and Figures.

If students choose to bind their thesis then they pay careful attention to formatting in order to maintain the margins of the paper (1.5" all around).  This can especially be a problem for Tables.

Appendices often include a student's curriculum vita, IRB approval form, and other materials.
