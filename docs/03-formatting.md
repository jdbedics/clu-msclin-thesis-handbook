## Title Page

This page provides the name of the thesis project, names of the university and school or department, and date of completion. The title page should be prepared in accordance with the sample page found in this section. The date at the bottom of the page is the month and year the degree is awarded. The title page is unnumbered but is counted as page “i.”

## Signature Page

This page provides the name of the author and blank lines for the signatures of the committee members, Program Director, and the Graduate Dean. The pages are signed when the committee members and Program Director determine that the thesis is complete. It should bear original signatures for all copies (typically three). The date at the bottom of the page is the date the degree is awarded; however, the page is not counted in the numbering system.

___

## Dedication (optional)

This optional page contains a brief dedication to the individual(s) whom the author wishes to honor. If included, this page is numbered as page “ii” (lower case Roman numeral).

___


## Acknowledgements (optional)

This optional page lists persons and/ or institutions whom the author wishes to thank for their assistance in completing the thesis or project. Such assistance can be provision of personal, financial, or moral support, or access to data sets or subject populations. A brief statement as to the type of assistance provided may follow each person or institution named. If included, this page continues the lower case Roman numeral sequence begun above.

___


## Table of Contents

The table of contents page will be consistent with the below image.  Students can include additional sections as they see fit.

___

## Abstract (APA style)

The abstract follows APA style and is typically completed in the Spring Semester of the second year.  A draft of the abstract, without results and without concluding statements, might be drafted during *PSYC 565 Research Practicum* during the of the second year. 

___


## Introduction (APA style)

As noted in the section ["Literature Review Timeline,"](#litreview) the introduction is drafted during the Fall Semester of the first year in *PSYC 564 Advanced Research Methods* and is revised every semester for the entire course of the program.  The introduction section is a comprehensive document that demonstrates the students' expertise in the area under study. 

In many theses, understanding involves an appreciation and discussion of culture and diversity. A literature review would be incomplete without such a review. 

___


## Method (APA style)

As noted in the ["Method Section Timeline,"](#method) portions of the Method section can be drafted during the Spring Semester of the first year and finalized during _PSYC 565 Research Practicum_ in the Fall Semester of the second year.  

The method section defines the procedures of the study and is required for successful IRB approval at CLU.  IRB is accomplished during _PSYC 565 Research Practicum_ in the Fall Semester of the second year but students should review CLU IRB requirements as soon as possible.  A link to the CLU IRB can be found here: [https://www.callutheran.edu/research/irb/](https://www.callutheran.edu/research/irb/). Students should, for example, complete their Ethical Training for the IRB as soon as possible (see CLU IRB website).


___


## Data Analytic Method (APA style)

The data analytic plan can be developed during _PSYC 562 Statistics II: Regression_ in the Spring Semester of the first year and finalized during _PSYC 565 Research Practicum_ in the Fall Semester of the second year.  

At CLU, we exclusively use the statistical program language called [R](https://www.r-project.org/). The data analytic section will also include a [power analysis](#method) as well a link to the study's [pre-registration](https://aspredicted.org/) of the data analysis as noted in the [method section of this manual](#method). 

___

## Results (APA style)

The results are typically drafted during the Spring Semester of the second year.  *PSYC 566 Thesis* is an independent study course.  There are no class meetings.  Instead, students meet with their thesis chair to review and write their analyses in the results section. 

The results section should be organized by study hypotheses.

___


## Discussion (APA style)

The discussion is a critical section of the research paper and is typically **10-pages** minimum.  In the discussion the student provide the following:

  * A summary of the proposed hypotheses and rationale.
  * A review of the results in narrative form without the presentation of any statistics.
  * A discussion of the implications of the results for each hypothesis. 
  * A discussion of future steps for each hypothesis.
  * A discussion of the limitations of the study in addressing each hypothesis.
  * Similar to the introduction, please consider culture and diversity in your discussion of the findings. 

The discussion section demonstrates the student's ability to place their study in the context of the larger literature and think more philosophically.  It is a space for creativity and ingenuity.  
  
___


## References (APA style)

References follow APA style.  Please make sure:

1. All citations _in text_ are in the _reference section_
2. All citations in the _reference section_ are cited _in text_.

___


## Tables, Figures, & Appendices (APA style)

Tables and Figures can be essential for helping a reader understand your data analysis and conclusions. Please follow APA formatting for all Tables and Figures.

If students choose to bind their thesis then they pay careful attention to formatting in order to maintain the margins of the paper (1.5" all around).  This can especially be a problem for Tables.

Appendices often include a student's curriculum vita, IRB approval form, and other materials.
