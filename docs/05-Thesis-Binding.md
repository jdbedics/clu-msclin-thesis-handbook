# Thesis Binding {#binding}

The following are instructions for binding your thesis.  The binding of your thesis is _optional_ and at your expense.You are responsible for the spelling, grammar, and correct APA formatting of your thesis. A bound thesis is a **final** thesis.^[The pricing is subject to change based on bindery costs.]  

1. The margins for the final thesis, throughout the whole document, should be 1.5" on **all** sides for binding. 

2. At least three (3) bound copies of the Thesis must be ordered.
    a.	One copy for the Graduate School of Psychology (required), one copy for the Thesis Committee Chair (the Chair might decline), and one personal copy for your possession. You can order more if you prefer. If the Chair declines, students still have to order 3 copies due to requirements from the bindery.
    b.	The three copies must be printed on _25% rag or cotton fiber watermarked white paper, at least 20 pound weight, 8½ x 11 inches in size_ (EZERASE, or similar paper is not acceptable). A good example is Southworth Fine Business Paper, 25% cotton, 24 pound, white, stock #403C which is available for purchase from Office Depot, OfficeMax, or Staples. A similar 20 pound weight paper is also available at  [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Southworth-Business-Cotton-Sheets-403C/dp/B00006IE2G/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=southworth+fine+business+paper+%23403c&qid=1590377859&sr=8-1). 
    c.	Original signed signature pages on the same paper must be submitted with each of the three copies.

3.	Additional personal copies may be ordered at the same time.
    a.	Personal copies may be printed on paper of the student’s choice (e.g., 20 pound paper).
    b.	Signature pages for the personal copies may be photocopies of the originals as long as they are on paper that is identical to the rest of the thesis.

4.	Copies for binding must be delivered to the Program Specialist.
    a.	The copies delivered to the Program Specialist sould be packaged with bright colored paper separating the individual copies.
    b.	Students are responsible for paying binding fees for all copies (the three required copies and for any additional personal copies). The cost is about $40 per copy (no matter the length), and to be paid by check to CLU.  Prices may change.
    c.	The Program Specialist will forward the copies to the bindery as they are delivered.

5.	The bound copies are typically ready in about 6-8 weeks and are distributed as follows:
    a.	The Graduate School of Psychology copy and the Thesis Committee Chair copy will be delivered via campus mail by the Program Specialist.
    b.	Students will be notified when their personal copies are ready for pick-up.

6.	If you have any questions regarding the binding process, please do not hesitate to contact Mengmeng Liu, Graduate Program Specialist, at 805-493-3662 or at mengmengliu@callutheran.edu.
