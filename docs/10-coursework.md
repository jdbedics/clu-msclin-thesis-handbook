# Coursework Relevant to the Thesis

___

The knowledge gained from each course taken can be used to improve the development of the thesis. For example, if you have a particular interest in a specific disorder then it makes sense that you study that disorder in *PSYC 510 Psychopathology*. In *PSYC 560 Statistics I: Exploratory Data Analysis*, you might consider finding open data that allows you to better understand your problem area through data visualization.  For example, if a student was interested in suicide they could examine open data from WHO and examine changing incidence rates across time and by countries.  

There are, however, specific courses where the thesis is explicitly incorporated into assignments.  The following are the MSCP courses that explicitly incorporate elements of the thesis into the syllabi:
