# Coursework Relevant to the Thesis

___

The knowledge gained from every course taken at CLU can be used to improve the development of the thesis. For example, if you have an interest in examining a specific disorder for your thesis then it makes sense that you study that disorder in *PSYC 510 Psychopathology*.   In *PSYC 560 Statistics I: Exploratory Data Analysis*, you might consider finding open data that allows you to better understand your problem area through data visualization.    

There are, however, specific courses where the thesis is explicitly incorporated into course assignments. The following are the MSCP courses that explicitly incorporate elements of the thesis into the syllabi: 

|PSYC#| Course           | Semester | Year | Task | 
|--|----------------|---------------|------|-----------|
| 564 | Adv. Research Methods | Fall | One | Literature Review |
| 562 | Statistics II: Regression | Spring | One | Data Analytic Plan |
| 552 | Psychometrics | Spring | One | Method |
| 521 | Ethics | Summer | One | Pre-Registration |
| 565 | Research Practicum | Fall | Two | IRB, Intro, Method |
| 566 | Thesis| Spring | Two | Complete Draft due May 1st |
| 599 | Thesis Continuation| Every semester | Two+ | Every semester until the thesis is complete |
