# Goal of the Handbook

___

The goal of this handbook is to provide students with the information needed to successfully complete the master's thesis in the MS in Clinical Psychology Program (MSCP) at California Lutheran University (CLU). The manual should be understood as a supplement to the broader policies and procedures defined by the program and university.

## Scholarly Research

___

Scholarly research requires the skills of inquiry as a method of addressing a problem. As a participant in research activities in the MS Clinical Program, the program expects students to develop the abilities to:

  1. Create or contribute empirical knowledge to the existing body of information in a discipline.
  2. Carryout systematic inquiry of a body of literature.
  3. Use tools of research including analyzing existing research, implementing research designs, using and/or developing instrumentation, employing appropriate methods of data analysis, and handling the logistics of conducting a research study.
  4. Work with faculty or other professionals on a research project.
  5. Use scholarly writing techniques.

Research conducted in the MS in Clinical Psychology program may be a thesis or a research project. While both are important contributions to the body of knowledge in a discipline, they have different purposes as described in the following sections.  The most critical being that the thesis is taken for credit and partial fulfillment of the degree and in replacement of the comprehensive exam.


___

## Comprehensive Exam


By default, students entering the MSCP program are required to complete the comprehensive exam.  Students can, however, choose to _opt out_ of the comprehensive exam and instead complete a thesis.

**What is the comprehensive exam?**

  * A closed book essay test that covers all the material studied during the program.  
  * The test is offered at the end of the spring semester during the second year. 
  * The exam consists of a morning session (9AM-Noon) and an afternoon session (1PM-4PM).
  * During each session, students choose to respond to 3 of 5 questions.
  
  
**How the comprehensive exam *replaces* the thesis**
    
  * Students register for the exam by paying a *comprehensive exam fee* during the semester they take the exam (typically spring of their 2nd year).
  * Students **do not** take *PSYC 566 Thesis (3 units)* in the spring of their 2nd year.  
  * As a result, students who take the comprehensive exams graduate with a total of **37-units** 
    instead of 40-units with the thesis option.
  * Students who take the comprehensive exam are also **not** required to take *PSYC 565 Research Practicum* in the fall of their 2nd year.  Instead, students can choose an elective course in consultation with the Program Diretor. 

  

___

## Thesis

The thesis is the result of an original empirical investigation that creates new knowledge within a discipline. It solves a problem related to lack of knowledge and is generally composed of the following elements:

  1. Identification of a problem caused by lack of knowledge;
  2. Background and literature review of existing information about the problem; 
  3. Methods to be used for obtaining the needed knowledge;
  4. Resulting new knowledge;
  5. Interpretation of the new knowledge;
  6. Transparent and open sharing of materials and results via pre-registration and the open science framework.

**Tasks:**

  * Students complete all the requirements outlined in this manual.
  * Students enroll in ***PSYC 565 Research Practicum (3 units)*** during the fall of their 2nd year.
  * Students enroll in ***PSYC 566 Thesis (3 units)*** during the spring of their 2nd year.
  * Students who fail to complete the thesis by the end of the 2nd year can:
    1. take ***PSYC 599-01 Thesis Continuation*** and pay all associated fees every semester until the thesis is completed or,
    2. take the comprehensive exam and pay the comprehensive exam fee.

___

## Pros and Cons: Thesis Vs. Comps

***Thesis "Pros"***
  
  * Students gain a high degree of expertise and mastery in the area under study.
  * The thesis timeline creates accountability and structure in completing the thesis.
  * Doctoral programs often look favorably towards a completed thesis that demonstrates students' ability to successfully complete a research project.
  * Doctoral programs that require a thesis might *waive* the thesis requirement based upon the completed thesis at CLU.
  * Students can have the thesis bound into a book (see Thesis Binding).
  * Students can earn quality letters for recommendation from their thesis committee members. These letters are often more meaningful than letters from employers or course instructors. 

***Thesis "Cons"***
  
  * Despite the structure offered through coursework, the thesis requires a considerable amount of extra work and self-discipline. The amount of autonomy and work can be quite stressful.
  * Students take an extra 3-units (PSYC 566) in the spring of their 2nd year for a total of 40-units versus 37-units for the comprehensive exam option. 

___

  
***Comps "Pros"***
  
  * Students are given a review sheet to help them study.
  * The exam is completed in a single day compared to the thesis that takes 2-years.
  * Questions that are not adequately answered can be successfully remitted before "failing."
  * Students can still complete an **research project** (see next section) which would allow the first three *thesis pros* to be achieved.
  * Students can choose any 3-credit elective during their second year (spring is recommended).
  * The entire program is 37-units versus 40-units with the thesis option.
  
***Comps "Cons"***
 
  * A 6-hour, closed book, essay test can be stressful and exhausting.
  * Research experience is valued by PHD programs and many, but not all, PSYD programs.
  * The research project, if chosen, could not be as structured as the thesis option.
  
___

## Research Project Option

**Research Project + Comprehensive Exam** 

Students can complete their own independent research project, identical to the thesis, but without the coursework (PSYC 566) and obligation to follow the requirements in this manual.  There are two scenarios where a student might choose to take the comprehensive exam and work on a research project :

  1. A student can decide, from the beginning of the program, that they want to avoid the pressure and extra work of the thesis requirements but use the program to work on an research project.  They could take PSYC 565 in the fall of their second year but will not take PSYC 566 during the spring.
  
  2. Students might attempt the thesis but, for a variety of reasons, fall behind and not be able to complete all the necessary requirements of the thesis in order to graduate. If this occurs, then the student can always move to the comprehensive exam (in order to graduate) while continuing to work on their thesis as an independent research project (for no credit).  
    
In both of these scenarios, students are required to take the comprehensive exam and pay the comprehensive exam fee in order to graduate and in in accordance with university policies which can be found through the [university registrar](https://www.callutheran.edu/students/registrar/).
