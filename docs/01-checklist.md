## Thesis Topic

___

**Defining the Problem Area**

The general thesis topic is required to be selected during the beginning of the first semester of the first year.  The thesis topic, does not, however, determine the hypotheses, methodology or general approach taken by the student to understand the problem (e.g. experimental, quasi-experimental, meta-analytic methods). It would be premature for any student to attempt to define a hypothesis in the first year when their understanding of the topic area is limited and not justified by a thorough literature review.  Hypotheses are typically developed after the first year of study. 

**Due**: October 1st, first year.

___


## Open Science Framework

**Creating a transparent and reproducible workflow**

![](images/osf.png)<!-- -->


[OSF](https://osf.io/) is a repository that allows researchers to transparently share their work with the larger scientific community. During the course of the program, students use OSF to organize their thesis and other independent research projects.  Instructions for setting up an OSF project can be found [here](https://speakerdeck.com/jdbedics/osf-setup-and-class-project-introduction) and will be reviewed with Dr. Bedics at students' first advising meeting. 

In addition to organizing students' workflow, OSF allows students to showcase their work to their peers and potential employers and doctoral advisors.  Students in the thesis option are required to use OSF and it is strongly recommended for students completing the research project. 

**Due**: October 1st, first year.

___


## Literature Review Timeline

___

**Understanding the Problem**

The development of the literature review begins during the fall of the first year during PSYC 564 Advanced Research Methods.  The literature review will become the "introduction" section of the final thesis paper.  The literature review demonstrates the student's mastery of the literature surrounding the *problem* to be addressed by the thesis.  Initial drafts, such as that from PSYC 564, are 10-12 pages in length.  

The development of the literature review is, however, ongoing throughout the two years of the program until the final draft is submitted on May 1st of the second year. The typical length of a *complete* literature review is between **20-40 pages** long but there is no maximum length. 

**Due**: 
  
  1. December 15th, first year (First Major Draft);
  2. May 15th, end of first year (Second Major Draft with Hypotheses); 
  3. May 1st, end of second year (Final Draft).

___


## Method Section Timeline

___

**Solving the Problem**

The method sections defines the procedures of the thesis. The method section consists of the participant selection, selection of methods of measurements or materials, the procedure and the data analytic method. The method section can be worked on in *PSYC 552 Psychometrics* during spring of the first year and also *PSYC 562 Statistics II: Regression.*  The method section is finalized during *PSYC 565 Research Practicum* in the fall of the second year.

**Due**: 

  1. May 1st, first year (First Draft);
  2. December 15th, second year (Second Draft)

___

## Committee Assignment

___

Committee members are faculty or experts in the field that support the students work on the thesis. Students work with the program director to find the most appropriate committee members to support their research project.  The committee is composed of a Chair and a Reader.  Their roles are described below as is the process for finding and selecting committee members. 

___

**Committee Chair**

The chair must have *content knowledge* of the area under investigation for the thesis. For example, if the thesis is on schizophrenia then the chair must have extensive knowledge of schizophrenia. The chair is either a part-time or full-time faculty member at CLU and is chosen with the approval of the Program Director, Dr. Bedics.  There can be exceptions to the above criteria with the approval of Dr. Bedics. 

**Committee Reader**

The reader must have either content knowledge or expert *methodological knowledge* of the area under investigation for the thesis. For example, if the thesis is on schizophrenia and utilizes an experimental design the the reader can either have knowledge of schizophrenia **or** knowledge of the experimental methods proposed.  The reader can be a part-time or full-time faculty member at CLU or a professional in the community with at least a Masterâ€™s degree that has the aforementioned expertise. The reader must be chosen with approval of program advisor and thesis Committee Chair. There can be exceptions to the above criteria with the approval of Dr. Bedics. 

___

Please see the **Thesis Committee** section of this handbook for information on how to acquire a committee. 
  
**Due**: June 30th, Summer after First Year

___

## Committee Approval of Proposal

___

During the summer following the first year, committee members read the literature review and method section and provide a general statement of approval to Dr. Bedics.  Based upon this approval, students are allowed to progress to the *thesis track.*  The rest of the thesis process is guided through coursework including PSYC 565 Research Practicum in the fall of the second year and PSYC 566 Thesis in the spring of the second year. 

**Due**: September 1st, Second Year

___

## Academic Good Standing

___

Academic good standing refers to maintaining a GPA above a 3.0 throughout the entire program and acting consistently with all policies and procedures defined by the program (see Program Handbook) and university (see university policy and procedures).  Any student who receives below a B- in any course is not allowed to complete the thesis for course credit and partial fulfillment of the degree. They can, however, complete a research project with the support of full-time faculty. 

**Due**: Every semester
