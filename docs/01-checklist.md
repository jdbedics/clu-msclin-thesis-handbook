## Thesis Topic - "Defining the Problem Area"

The general thesis topic is required to be selected during the beginning of the first semester of the first year.  The thesis topic, does not, however, determine the hypotheses, methodology or general approach taken by the student to understand the problem (e.g. experimental, quasi-experimental, meta-analytic methods). It would be premature for a student to define a hypothesis in the first year when their understanding of the topic area is just beginning.

**Due**: October 1st, First Year

## Literature Review - "Understanding the Problem"

The development of the literature review begins during the fall of the first during PSYC 564 Advanced Research Methods.  The literature review will become the "introduction" section of the final thesis project and demostrates the student's mastery of the literature surrounding the *problem* to be addressed by the thesis.  The typical length of a *complete* literature review is between 20-40 pages longs but there is no maximum length.  Initial drafts, such as that from PSYC 564, will be 10-12 pages in length.  The development of the literture review is ongoing throughout the two years of the program until its completion on May 1st of the second year.

**Due**: December 15th, First year (First Major Draft); May 15th, end of first year (Second Major Draft); May 1st, end of second year (Final Draft)

## Method Section - "Solving the Problem"

The method sections defines the procedures of the thesis project. The method section consists of the participant selection, selection of methods of measurements or materials, and the procedure.  The method section can be worked on in PSYC 552 Psychometrics during spring of the first year. 

**Due**: May 1st, First Year (First Draft)

## Committee Assignment

Committee members are faculty or experts in the field that support the students work on the thesis. Students work with the program director to find the most appropriate committee members to support their research project.  

  * Students select *2* committee members including a chair and a reader
  * One committee member must be affiliated with CLU; the second committee member can be from CLU or another institution
  * Committee members typically hold doctoral degrees in areas that support the students research
  * Students typically select a committee member who has domain expertise (often the chair) and one that has methodology expertise (reader).  
  * All committee members are approved by Dr. Bedics. 
  
**Due**: June 30th, Summer after First Year

## Committee Approval of Proposal

During the summer following the first year, committee members read the literature review and method section and provide a general statement of approval to Dr. Bedics.  Based upon this approval, students are allowed to progress to the *thesis track.*  The rest of the thesis process is guided through coursework including PSYC 565 Research Practicum in the fall of the second year and PSYC 566 Thesis in the spring of the second year. 

**Due**: October 1st, Second Year

## Academic Good Standing

Academic good standing refers to maintaining a GPA above a 3.0 throughout the entire program and acting consistently with all policies and procedures defined by the program (see Program Handbook) and university (see university policy and procedures).  Any student who receives below a B- in any course is not allowed to complete the thesis for course credit and partial fulfillment of the degree.
