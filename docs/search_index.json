"],["introduction-apa-style.html", "4.7 Introduction (APA style)", " 4.7 Introduction (APA style) Understanding the Problem The development of the literature review begins during the Fall Semester of the first year during PSYC 564 Advanced Research Methods. The literature review will become the “introduction” section of the final thesis paper. The literature review demonstrates the student’s mastery of the literature surrounding the problem to be addressed by the thesis. Initial drafts, such as that from PSYC 564, are 10-12 pages in length. The development of the literature review is, however, ongoing throughout the two-years of the program until the final draft is submitted on May 1st of the second year. The typical length of a completed introduction section is maximum 10 pages long although exceptions can be made to go over the maximum. In terms of content, students are encouraged to consider multiple perspectives in their work and also to integrate their thoughts related to culture and diversity regarding the topic area. The idea here is that a good understanding of a problem area involves a thorough understanding of the context. Context includes a consideration of the place, time, and people under study as well as the same characteristics of those who are doing the investigating.

In the discussion the student provide the following: A summary of the proposed hypotheses and rationale. A review of the results in narrative form without the presentation of any statistics. A discussion of the implications of the results for each hypothesis. A discussion of future steps for each hypothesis. A discussion of the limitations of the study in addressing each hypothesis. Similar to the introduction, please consider culture and diversity in your discussion of the findings. The discussion section demonstrates the student’s ability to place their study in the context of the larger literature and think more philosophically. It is a space for creativity and ingenuity.

Please follow APA formatting for all Tables and Figures.
