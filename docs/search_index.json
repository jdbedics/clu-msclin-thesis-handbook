Students who miss any step will be automatically removed from the thesis option and required to complete the comprehensive exam. The student can, however, complete a research project but not for the partial fulfillment of the degree (i.e., credit). Missing any of the above steps will move the student back to the comprehensive exam option. Task Date Due Year Finished 1. Topic Approved September 15th First Year [_____] 2.
