["comprehensive-exams-or-thesis.html", "1.1 Comprehensive Exams or Thesis?", " 1.1 Comprehensive Exams or Thesis? Upon enrolling the MSCP program, students are expected to complete the comprehensive exam in order to complete the degree. Students can, however, choose to complete a thesis project which would replace the the comprehensive exam option. What is the comprehensive exam?: The comprehensive exam is a closed book/note essay test that covers all the material studied during the course of the MSCP program. The test is offered at the end of the spring semester during the second year. The exam consists of a morning session (9AM-Noon) and an afternoon session (1PM-4PM). During each session, students choose to respond to 3 of 5 essay style questions. Choosing the comprehensive exam results in 3 less credit hours for the completion of the program for a total of 37-units. Instead, in their final semester students pay a comprehensive exam fee. In addition, students taking the comprehensive exams can choose to take PSYC 565 Research Practicum in the fall of their second year or, instead, take an extra elective with Dr. Bedics’ approval. "],
["thesis-project.html", "1.2 Thesis Project", " 1.2 Thesis Project Students who choose to work on a thesis must follow the procedures and guidelines in this manual in order to stay in the thesis track. Students who fail to follow any of these steps will be moved back to the comprehensive exam option. Students can, however, continue to work on their research project as an independent project and not for partial fulfillment of the requirements of the program (i.e., credit). Students choosing the thesis must enroll in PSYC 565 and PSYC 566 during the fall and spring semester of their second year, respectively. PSYC 565 can, however, be taken if students are choosing to complete an independent research project and would like structured faculty assistance. The completion of 566 for 3-units results in a total of 40-units for the completion of the degree. Bottom line: The main benefit of the thesis project is that it provides students with the opportunity to conduct their own independent research project with the support of faculty. Whether you choose to do this as a thesis or an independent project, in reality, matters little to future doctoral program. Instead, future advisors will be looking at the quality of work regardless of the status of the project. "],

The binding of your thesis is optional and at your expense.You are responsible for the spelling, grammar, and correct APA formatting of your thesis. A bound thesis is a final thesis. At least three (3) bound copies of the Thesis must be ordered. One copy for the Graduate School of Psychology, one copy for the Thesis Committee Chair, and one personal copy for your possession. You can order more if you prefer (see #2). The three copies must be printed on 25% rag or cotton fiber watermarked white paper, at least 20 pound weight, 8½ x 11 inches in size (EZERASE, or similar paper is not acceptable). A good example is Southworth Fine Business Paper, 25% cotton, 24 pound, white, stock #403C which is available for purchase from Office Depot, OfficeMax, and Staples. A similar 20 pound weight paper is also available. Original signed signature pages on the same paper must be submitted with each of the three copies. Additional personal copies may be ordered at the same time. Personal copies may be printed on paper of the student’s choice (e.g., 20 pound paper). Signature pages for the personal copies may be photocopies of the originals as long as they are on paper that is identical to the rest of the thesis. Copies for binding must be delivered to the Program Specialist. The copies delivered to the Program Specialist are NOT to be bound - just packaged with bright colored paper separating the individual copies. Students are responsible for paying binding fees for all copies (the three required copies and for any additional personal copies). The cost is $40 per copy (no matter the length), and to be paid by check to CLU. Prices may change. The Program Specialist will forward the copies to the bindery as they are delivered. Once the Program Specialist receives the copies and payment for binding, a change of grade will be submitted to the Registrar’s Office.
