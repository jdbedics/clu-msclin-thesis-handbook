["comprehensive-exam-or-thesis.html", "1.1 Comprehensive Exam or Thesis?", " 1.1 Comprehensive Exam or Thesis? By default, students entering the MSCP program are required to complete the comprehensive exam. Students can, however, choose to opt out of the comprehensive exam and instead complete a thesis project. What is the comprehensive exam? A closed book essay test that covers all the material studied during the course of the MSCP program. The test is offered at the end of the spring semester during the second year. The exam consists of a morning session (9AM-Noon) and an afternoon session (1PM-4PM). During each session, students choose to respond to 3 of 5 questions. Instead of credits, students pay a comprehensive exam fee during the semester they take the exam. Students do not have to take PSYC 565, Research Practicum, in the fall and can instead choose an additional elective during their second year in the program. Students do not take PSYC 566, Thesis, in the spring of their second year. Thesis Project Students complete all the requirements outline in this manual Students enroll in PSYC 565, Research Seminar, during the fall of their second year Students enroll in PSYC 566, Thesis, during the spring of their second year Pros and Cons Thesis “Pros” Students gain a high degree of expertise and mastery in the particular area under study. The thesis timeline creates accountability and structure in developing students’ research project. Doctoral programs might look favorably towards a completed thesis that demonstrates students ability to complete an independent research project. Doctoral programs that require a thesis might waive the thesis requirement based on students’ completed thesis at CLU. Students can have the thesis bound into a book. Thesis “Cons” Despite the structure offered through coursework, the thesis requires a considerable amount of work and self-discipline and the stress associate with this extra work. Students take an extra 3-units (PSYC 566) in the spring of their second year for a total of 40-units versus 37-units for the comprehensive exam option. Comps “Pros” A review sheet is provided to help focus student’s efforts to study. The exam is done in a day. Questions that are not adequately answered can be remitted before “failing.” The pressure to meet thesis requirements, every semester, is removed. Students can still complete an independent research project (see below) which would include the first three thesis pros Students choose a 3-credit elective during their second year The entire program is 37-units versus 40-units with the thesis option Comps “Cons” A 6-hour, closed book, essay test can be stressful and exhausting The independent research project could not be as structured as the thesis option. Independent Research Project + Comprehensive Exam Students can complete their own independent research project, identical to the thesis, but without the coursework (PSYC 565 &amp; PSCY 566). There are three scenarios where this can occur: A student can decide, from the beginning of the program, that they want to avoid the pressure and extra work of the thesis requirements but use the program to work on an independent research project. They could take PSYC 565 in the fall of their second year but will not take PSYC 566 during the spring. Students might attempt the thesis but, for a variety of reasons, fall behind and be removed from or quite the thesis track. In both of these scenarios, students are required to take the comprehensive exam and pay the comprehensive exam fee, in order to graduate. The student can, however, continue to work on their independent research project but not for credit. "],

["thesis-binding.html", "Section 6 Thesis Binding", " Section 6 Thesis Binding The following are instructions for binding your thesis. The binding of your thesis is optional and at your expense.You are responsible for the spelling, grammar, and correct APA formatting of your thesis. A bound thesis is a final thesis. At least three (3) bound copies of the Thesis must be ordered. One copy for the Graduate School of Psychology, one copy for the Thesis Committee Chair, and one personal copy for your possession. You can order more if you prefer (see #2). The three copies must be printed on 25% rag or cotton fiber watermarked white paper, at least 20 pound weight, 8½ x 11 inches in size (EZERASE, or similar paper is not acceptable). A good example is Southworth Fine Business Paper, 25% cotton, 24 pound, white, stock #403C which is available for purchase from Office Depot, OfficeMax, and Staples. A similar 20 pound weight paper is also available. Original signed signature pages on the same paper must be submitted with each of the three copies. Additional personal copies may be ordered at the same time. Personal copies may be printed on paper of the student’s choice (e.g., 20 pound paper). Signature pages for the personal copies may be photocopies of the originals as long as they are on paper that is identical to the rest of the thesis. Copies for binding must be delivered to the Program Specialist. The copies delivered to the Program Specialist are NOT to be bound - just packaged with bright colored paper separating the individual copies. Students are responsible for paying binding fees for all copies (the three required copies and for any additional personal copies). The cost is $40 per copy (no matter the length), and to be paid by check to CLU. Prices may change. The Program Specialist will forward the copies to the bindery as they are delivered. Once the Program Specialist receives the copies and payment for binding, a change of grade will be submitted to the Registrar’s Office.
