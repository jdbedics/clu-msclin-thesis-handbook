["scholarly-research.html", "1.1 Scholarly Research", " 1.1 Scholarly Research Scholarly research requires the skills of inquiry which must be demonstrated by all students. As a participant in research activities at CLU, the University expects you to develop the abilities to: Create or contribute empirical knowledge to the existing body of information in a discipline; Carryout systematic inquiry; Use tools of research including analyzing existing research, implementing research designs, using and/or developing instrumentation, employing appropriate methods of data analysis, and handling the logistics of conducting a research study; Work with faculty or other professionals on a research project; Use scholarly writing techniques. Research may be a thesis or a research project. While both are important contributions to the body of knowledge in a discipline, they have different purposes as described in the following sections.

["comprehensive-exam.html", "1.2 Comprehensive Exam", " 1.2 Comprehensive Exam By default, students entering the MSCP program are required to complete the comprehensive exam. Students can, however, choose to opt out of the comprehensive exam and instead complete a thesis. What is the comprehensive exam? A closed book essay test that covers all the material studied during the program. The test is offered at the end of the spring semester during the second year. The exam consists of a morning session (9AM-Noon) and an afternoon session (1PM-4PM). During each session, students choose to respond to 3 of 5 questions. How the comprehensive exam replaces the thesis Students register for the exam by paying a comprehensive exam fee during the semester they take the exam (typically spring of their 2nd year). Students do not take PSYC 566 Thesis (3 units) in the spring of their 2nd year. As a result, students who take the comprehensive exams graduate with a total of 37-units instead of 40-units with the thesis option. Students who take the comprehensive exam are also not required to take PSYC 565 Research Practicum in the fall of their 2nd year. Students can choose an elective of their choosing which could be PSYC 565 if they choose. "],
["thesis.html", "1.3 Thesis", " 1.3 Thesis The thesis is the result of an original empirical investigation that creates new knowledge within a discipline. It solves a problem related to lack of knowledge and is generally composed of the following elements: Identification of a problem caused by lack of knowledge; Background and literature review of existing information about the problem; Methods to be used for obtaining the needed knowledge; Resulting new knowledge; Interpretation of the new knowledge; Transparent and open sharing of materials and results via pre-registration and the open science framework. Tasks: Students complete all the requirements outlined in this manual. Students enroll in PSYC 565 Research Practicum (3 units) during the fall of their 2nd year. Students enroll in PSYC 566 Thesis (3 units) during the spring of their 2nd year. Students who fail to complete the thesis by the end of the 2nd year can: take PSYC 599-01 Thesis Continuation and pay all associated fees every semester until the thesis is completed or, take the comprehensive exam and pay the comprehensive exam fee.

["pros-and-cons-thesis-vs-comps.html", "1.4 Pros and Cons: Thesis Vs. Comps", " 1.4 Pros and Cons: Thesis Vs. Comps Thesis “Pros” Students gain a high degree of expertise and mastery in the area under study. The thesis timeline creates accountability and structure in completing the thesis. Doctoral programs often look favorably towards a completed thesis that demonstrates students’ ability to successfully complete a research project. Doctoral programs that require a thesis might waive the thesis requirement based upon the completed thesis at CLU. Students can have the thesis bound into a book (see Thesis Binding). Students can earn quality letters for recommendation from their thesis committee members. These letters are often more meaningful than letters from employers or course instructors. Thesis “Cons” Despite the structure offered through coursework, the thesis requires a considerable amount of extra work and self-discipline. The amount of autonomy and work can be quite stressful. Students take an extra 3-units (PSYC 566) in the spring of their 2nd year for a total of 40-units versus 37-units for the comprehensive exam option. Comps “Pros” Students are given a review sheet to help them study. The exam is completed in a single day compared to the thesis that takes 2-years. Questions that are not adequately answered can be successfully remitted before “failing.” Students can still complete an research project (see next section) which would allow the first three thesis pros to be achieved. Students can choose any 3-credit elective during their second year (spring is recommended). The entire program is 37-units versus 40-units with the thesis option. Comps “Cons” A 6-hour, closed book, essay test can be stressful and exhausting. Research experience is valued by PHD programs and many, but not all, PSYD programs. The research project, if chosen, could not be as structured as the thesis option. "],
["research-project-option.html", "1.5 Research Project Option", " 1.5 Research Project Option Research Project + Comprehensive Exam Students can complete their own independent research project, identical to the thesis, but without the coursework (PSYC 566) and obligation to follow the requirements in this manual. There are two scenarios where a student might choose to take the comprehensive exam and work on a research project : A student can decide, from the beginning of the program, that they want to avoid the pressure and extra work of the thesis requirements but use the program to work on an research project. They could take PSYC 565 in the fall of their second year but will not take PSYC 566 during the spring. Students might attempt the thesis but, for a variety of reasons, fall behind and not be able to complete all the necessary requirements of the thesis in order to graduate. If this occurs, then the student can always move to the comprehensive exam (in order to graduate) while continuing to work on their thesis as an independent research project (for no credit). In both of these scenarios, students are required to take the comprehensive exam and pay the comprehensive exam fee in order to graduate and in in accordance with university policies which can be found through the university registrar.

["thesis-committee.html", "Section 2 Thesis Committee", " Section 2 Thesis Committee Finding a Committee For many faculty, being on a thesis committee is a lot of work and they are often reluctant to join a committee. Consequently, how students choose to approach faculty is very critical. Dr. Bedics will walk students through much of the process. 1. Identifying Potential Faculty Search the CLU website for potential faculty that could contribute to your idea. Look at faculty interests in graduate psychology, undergraduate psychology, as well as other departments at CLU. Students could also identify faculty at other universities that might serve on the committee. Once identified, students should email Dr. Bedics to discuss prior to students contacting the faculty themselves. 2. Foot-in-the-Door Students first introduce themselves to faculty through email. Do not ask them to join your committee in the first email. Instead, ask them if they have time to answer questions about your project. If they don’t have time or incentive to do this simple task then they will not be willing to be on your committee. The foot-in-the-door strategy allows students to gain feedback from the person even if they are not willing to be on students’ committee. Here is a properly formatted and professional email using the foot-in-the-door strategy: Dear Dr. ###, My name is STUDENT and I am currently developing my master’s thesis project at California Lutheran University in the MS Clinical Psychology Program. The topic is &lt;TOPIC&gt;. I think your expertise in &lt;AREA&gt; would help me in thinking through some of the details of the thesis. I was curious if you could make time to answer a few questions over email or perhaps even chat over the phone or during your office hours? I have attached a brief summary of my project. Thank you for your time and consideration. Sincerely, First Name Last Name If they reply, and are positive, then you it is your responsibility to be flexible with your time. Also, please never ask for an appointment in the same week. 3. Requesting Committee Membership – If the initial meeting goes well then Dr. Bedics will email the faculty member to discuss the role of the chair and reader. 4. Working with your committee The committee will be most successful when students establish clear expectations for meeting with their committee members. Clearly established expectations will prevent you from emailing too little or too much. It is best to suggest fewer meetings, perhaps one at the beginning and one at the end of the semester. You will have more meetings with your chair than your reader. Establish the following: Make a clear statement that you are respectful of their time and do not want to meet too much or too little. Faculty often appreciate such direct and respectful statements. Suggest two meetings a semester and go from there. They might suggest more or a timeline based on other criteria. "],

["thesis-topic.html", "3.1 Thesis Topic", " 3.1 Thesis Topic Defining the Problem Area The general thesis topic is required to be selected during the beginning of the first semester of the first year. The thesis topic, does not, however, determine the hypotheses, methodology or general approach taken by the student to understand the problem (e.g. experimental, quasi-experimental, meta-analytic methods). It would be premature for any student to attempt to define a hypothesis in the first year when their understanding of the topic area is limited and not justified by a thorough literature review. Hypotheses are typically developed after the first year of study. Tips for finding a Topic Students are often unnecessarily delayed in choosing a thesis topic area to study. The ambivalence can cause a significant delay in their progress and result in an inferior product. Students should keep a few ideas in mind: It certainly is helpful if you are passionate about the topic. When a person is passionate about a topic it means they naturally want to read and understand the area under study. They often go to sleep thinking about the topic and wake up already thinking about the topic and what they want to accomplish that day. Passion often starts by examining interest and is acquired through hard work. It is okay if you are not passionate about any particular problem area. If you have an area that you are interested in then that’s a good start and simple select one area and make that your focus. Select one interest. The problem is we all have multiple interests. You really like schizophrenia but at the same time you’re really interested in forensic psychology and the prison system. One semester you might want to study psychosis and the next semester you might have more interest in the prison system. Students can “flip flop” not because of ambivanlence or some “problem.” They’re both just interested to the student and they can’t decide. Unfortunately, this process has two problems. First, it can assume there is a right area to be studying and you should feel one area more than another. Second, it delays the students ability to make a good project. Our advice is to stick with your decision regardless how you feel. Passion comes from hard work, lots of reading, lots of conversations especially during times when you are not feeling it or doubtful. Most importantly, passion and expertise cannot come if you are not focused on one topic. The thesis will not define you. Student’s should understand that the topic they select to study will not define their career. In this sense, the thesis topic itself is really not all that important. What is most important is that the students learns how to become scholar and do research. Students cannot do that if they do not commit to the thesis topic early in the first semester. In sum, it would be nice if you are passionate or, at minimum, interested in the topic but it simply is not necessary nor is it expected for you to get the most out of the master’s program. Due: October 1st, first year. "],
["open-science-framework.html", "3.2 Open Science Framework", " 3.2 Open Science Framework Creating a transparent and reproducible workflow OSF is a repository that allows researchers to transparently share their work with the larger scientific community. During the course of the program, students use OSF to organize their thesis and other independent research projects. Instructions for setting up an OSF project can be found here and will be reviewed with Dr. Bedics at students’ first advising meeting. In addition to organizing students’ workflow, OSF allows students to showcase their work to their peers and potential employers and doctoral advisors. Students in the thesis option are required to use OSF and it is strongly recommended for students completing the research project. Due: October 1st, first year. "],

The literature review demonstrates the student’s mastery of the literature surrounding the problem to be addressed by the thesis. Initial drafts, such as that from PSYC 564, are 10-12 pages in length. The development of the literature review is, however, ongoing throughout the two years of the program until the final draft is submitted on May 1st of the second year. The typical length of a complete literature review is between 20-40 pages long but there is no maximum length.

["committee-assignment.html", "3.5 Committee Assignment", " 3.5 Committee Assignment Committee members are faculty or experts in the field that support the students work on the thesis. Students work with the program director to find the most appropriate committee members to support their research project. The committee is composed of a Chair and a Reader. Their roles are described below as is the process for finding and selecting committee members. Committee Chair The chair must have content knowledge of the area under investigation for the thesis. For example, if the thesis is on schizophrenia then the chair must have extensive knowledge of schizophrenia. The chair is either a part-time or full-time faculty member at CLU and is chosen with the approval of the Program Director, Dr. Bedics. There can be exceptions to the above criteria with the approval of Dr. Bedics. Committee Reader The reader must have either content knowledge or expert methodological knowledge of the area under investigation for the thesis. For example, if the thesis is on schizophrenia and utilizes an experimental design the the reader can either have knowledge of schizophrenia or knowledge of the experimental methods proposed. The reader can be a part-time or full-time faculty member at CLU or a professional in the community with at least a Master’s degree that has the aforementioned expertise. The reader must be chosen with approval of program advisor and thesis Committee Chair. There can be exceptions to the above criteria with the approval of Dr. Bedics.

Any student who receives below a B- in any course is not allowed to complete the thesis for course credit and partial fulfillment of the degree. They can, however, complete a research project with the support of full-time faculty. Due: Every semester "],
["coursework-relevant-to-the-thesis.html", "Section 4 Coursework Relevant to the Thesis", " Section 4 Coursework Relevant to the Thesis The knowledge gained from every course taken at CLU can be used to improve the development of the thesis. For example, if you have an interest in examining a specific disorder for your thesis then it makes sense that you study that disorder in PSYC 510 Psychopathology. In PSYC 560 Statistics I: Exploratory Data Analysis, you might consider finding open data that allows you to better understand your problem area through data visualization. There are, however, specific courses where the thesis is explicitly incorporated into course assignments. The following are the MSCP courses that explicitly incorporate elements of the thesis into the syllabi: PSYC# Course Semester Year Task 564 Adv. Research Methods Fall One Start Lit Review; Start References 562 Statistics II: Regression Spring One Data Analytic Plan 552 Psychometrics Spring One Method 521 Ethics Summer One Pre-Registration 565 Research Practicum Fall Two IRB, Intro, Method 566 Thesis Spring Two Complete Draft due May 1st 599 Thesis Continuation Every semester Post 2nd year Two+ Every semester until the thesis is complete PSYC 564 Advanced Research Methods In PSYC 564, students develop the beginning of their literature review and begin to master the 7th edition of the Publication Manual by the American Psychological Association (see formatting section). PSYC 562: Statistics II: Regression In this course, students learn the basics of statistical modeling with an emphasis on regression. Although the focus of the course is on regression, students can work with the instructor to consider models that might address their research hypotheses. If students have a published article that closely approximates the study they want to run then students might learn more about the analyses conducted in that article. PSYC 552: Psychometrics The emphasis on this course is psychometric theory which includes an understanding of the concepts of reliability and validity. Students can use this course to examining the psychometric properties of the most likely methods of measurement such as self-report questionnaires. PSYC 521: Clinical and Research Ethics In this course, students learn about the concept of open science which include reproducibility, transparency, and pre-registration. Students continue to develop their OSF page and learn how to pre-register their hypotheses. PSYC 565: Research Practicum In addition to finishing up their introduction and method sections, students main task is to complete the CLU IRB, https://www.callutheran.edu/research/irb/. The IRB process is very extensive and students are required to complete an online ethical training. Once the IRB is successfully passed, students can collect their data. The process of getting IRB approval can be a lengthy one and require several revisions. Students submit their IRB in collaboration with their committee chair who will submit the IRB proposal to the IRB committee on the student’s behalf. A critical part of the thesis is the power analysis. The power analysis determines whether or not the proposed study will be able to accomplish the proposed goals (i.e., adequately test the hypothesis(-es)). The most basic application of the power analysis is to determine the required sample size necessary to find the effect most likely to be achieved given prior work in the field. Students will complete a power analysis prior to submitting their IRB. PSYC 566: Thesis During this semester, students work independently on their thesis (with their committee members) and complete their results and discussion sections. The semester requires the student to structure their own time as their are no formal class meetings. Students are often collecting data during this final semester. In order to pass PSYC 566, students are required to have a complete draft of their thesis that is approved by the chair, reader, and program director. Students often do not complete thesis for a variety of reasons including an inability to collect data, medical and health problems, or other life priorities. In these circumstances, students have two options: 1. Continue the thesis - Students can choose to continue the thesis and enroll in PSYC 599, and pay the feel, every semester until the thesis is complete. Students are assigned the following grade for PSYC 566 until the thesis is approved: “IP” (In Progress) is given for theses, practica, internships and courses wherein the work has been evaluated and found to be satisfactory to date, but the assignment of a grade must await its completion. “IP” carries no credit until replaced by a permanent grade. The “IP” grade may be replaced by the appropriate final letter grade within one calendar year from the start of the class. “IP” grades which have not been resolved will be changed to “F” (undergraduate) or “NC” (graduate) at the time the student’s degree is posted. 2. Drop the Thesis and take the Comprehensive Exam - Students can register for the comprehensive exam and pay the associated fee. The comprehensive exam is offered every semester and should be taken the first semester the student does not register for PSYC 599. PSYC 599: Thesis Continuation Students who do not complete the thesis by the end of their second year and choose to continue to work on thesis must register for PSYC 599 every semester until the thesis is approved.
