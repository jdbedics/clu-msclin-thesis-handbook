The manual should be understood as a supplement to the broader policies and procedures defined by the program and university. Updates can be found at: https://jdbedics.github.io/thesishandbook/ "],
["scholarly-research.html", "1.1 Scholarly Research", " 1.1 Scholarly Research Overview: Scholarly research requires the skills of scientific inquiry as a method of addressing a problem. As a participant in research activities in the MSCP program, students are expected to develop the following abilities: Create or contribute empirical knowledge to the existing body of information in a discipline. Carryout systematic inquiry of a body of literature. Use tools of research including analyzing existing research, implementing research designs, using and/or developing instrumentation, employing appropriate methods of data analysis, and handling the logistics of conducting a research study. Work with faculty or other professionals on a research project. Use scholarly writing techniques including the mastery of the new APA Publication Manual 7th Edition. Create and share reproducible and transparent research materials including open data and code consistent with the principles of open science. Research conducted in the MSCP program may be a thesis or a research project. While both are important contributions to the body of knowledge in a discipline, they have different purposes as described in the following sections. The most critical being that the thesis is taken for credit and partial fulfillment of the degree and in replacement of the comprehensive exam. "],
["comprehensive-exam.html", "1.2 Comprehensive Exam", " 1.2 Comprehensive Exam By default, students entering the MSCP program are required to complete the comprehensive exam. Students can, however, choose to opt out of the comprehensive exam and instead complete a thesis. What is the comprehensive exam? A closed book essay test that covers all the material studied during the program. The test is offered at the end of the spring semester during the second year. The exam consists of a morning session (9AM-Noon) and an afternoon session (1PM-4PM). During each session, students choose to respond to 3 of 5 questions. Students are given a thorough review sheet to facilitate studying for the exam. How the comprehensive exam replaces the thesis Students register for the exam by paying a comprehensive exam fee during the semester they take the exam (typically spring of their 2nd year). Students do not take PSYC 566 Thesis (3 units) in the spring of their 2nd year. As a result, students who take the comprehensive exams graduate with a total of 37-units instead of 40-units with the thesis option. Students who take the comprehensive exam are also not required to take PSYC 565 Research Practicum in the fall of their 2nd year. Instead, students can choose an elective course in consultation with the Program Director.1 As noted below, students can intend to complete the thesis and take PSYC 565 and PSYC 566 but switch to the comprehensive exam for a variety of reasons. In these cases, students are still required to pay the comprehensive exam fee although they have already paid for thesis units.↩ "],
["thesis.html", "1.3 Thesis", " 1.3 Thesis The thesis is the result of an original empirical investigation that creates new knowledge within a discipline. It attempts to address a problem related to lack of knowledge and is generally composed of the following elements: Identification of a problem caused by lack of knowledge; Background and literature review of existing information about the problem; Methods to be used for obtaining the needed knowledge; Resulting new knowledge; Interpretation of the new knowledge; Transparent and open sharing of materials and results through the use of the open science framework. Tasks: Students complete all the requirements outlined in this manual. Students enroll in PSYC 565 Research Practicum (3 units) during the fall of their 2nd year. Students enroll in PSYC 566 Thesis (3 units) during the spring of their 2nd year. Students who fail to complete the thesis by the end of the 2nd year can: Take PSYC 599-01 Thesis Continuation and pay all associated fees every semester until the thesis is completed or, Take the comprehensive exam and pay the comprehensive exam fee in the semester immediately following the last semster thesis units were taken.

["research-project-option.html", "1.4 Research Project Option", " 1.4 Research Project Option Research Project + Comprehensive Exam Students can complete their own independent research project, identical to the thesis, but without the coursework (PSYC 565 or PSYC 566) and obligation to follow the requirements in this manual. There are two scenarios where a student might choose to take the comprehensive exam and work on a research project : A student can decide, from the beginning of the program, that they want to avoid the pressure and extra work of the thesis requirements but use the program to work on an research project at their own pace and with faulty support. They could take PSYC 565 in the fall of their second year to support their research project but will not take PSYC 566 during the spring. In this case, PSYC 565 will act as their elective. Students might attempt the thesis but, for a variety of reasons, fall behind and not be able to complete all the necessary requirements of the thesis in order to graduate. If this occurs, then the student can always move to the comprehensive exam (in order to graduate) while continuing to work on their thesis as an independent research project (for no credit). In both of these scenarios, students are required to take the comprehensive exam and pay the comprehensive exam fee in order to graduate. "],
["pros-and-cons-thesis-vs-comps.html", "1.5 Pros and Cons: Thesis Vs. Comps", " 1.5 Pros and Cons: Thesis Vs. Comps Thesis “Pros” Students gain a high degree of expertise and mastery in the area under study. The thesis timeline creates accountability and structure in completing the thesis. Doctoral programs often look favorably towards a completed thesis that demonstrates students’ ability to successfully complete a research project. Doctoral programs that require a thesis might waive the thesis requirement based upon the completed thesis at CLU. Students can have the thesis bound into a book (see Section 6 Thesis Binding). Students can earn quality letters for recommendation from their thesis committee members. These letters are often more meaningful than letters from employers or course instructors. Thesis “Cons” Despite the structure offered through coursework, the thesis requires a considerable amount of extra work and self-discipline. The amount of autonomy and work can be quite stressful. Students take an extra 3-units (PSYC 566) in the spring of their 2nd year for a total of 40-units versus 37-units for the comprehensive exam option. Comps “Pros” Students are given a review sheet to help them study. The exam is completed in a single day compared to the thesis that takes 2-years. Questions that are not adequately answered can be successfully remitted before “failing.” Students can still complete an research project (see next section) which would allow the first three thesis pros to be achieved. A good research project is just as valued as a good thesis. Students can choose any 3-credit elective during their second year (spring is recommended). The entire program is 37-units versus 40-units with the thesis option. Comps “Cons” A 6-hour, closed book, essay test can be stressful and exhausting. Research experience is valued by PHD programs and many, but not all, PSYD programs. The research project, if chosen, could not be as structured as the thesis option. "],

["thesis-topic-selection.html", "2.1 Thesis Topic Selection", " 2.1 Thesis Topic Selection Defining the Problem Area The general thesis topic is required to be selected during the beginning of the first semester of the first year. The thesis topic, does not, however, determine the hypotheses, methodology or general approach taken by the student to understand the problem (e.g. experimental, quasi-experimental, meta-analytic methods). It would be premature for any student to attempt to define a hypothesis in the first year when their understanding of the topic area is limited and not justified by a thorough literature review. Hypotheses are typically developed after the first year of study when the student has a better grasp of the problem to be solved (see the Wampold article in Section 10 References for a guide on hypothesis development). Tips for finding a Topic Students are often unnecessarily delayed in choosing a broad area to study which can impact the success of the thesis. In choosing a topic students should keep a few points in mind: It certainly is helpful if you are passionate about the topic. When a person is passionate about a topic they naturally want to read about and understand the area under study. They often go to bed thinking about the topic and will wake up excited and thinking about what they will do that day related to their project. It can be a very exciting time because you’re working on something you love and have fun doing. Reflect on your interests. It’s okay if you are not particularly passionate about any specific area of study. Passion often starts by first examining an area of interest with some degree of focus, commitment, and consistency. If you have an area of interest then the next step is to simply select one area, commit to it, and start reading and writing. Passion often comes after we put the work in. Select one interest. Don’t flip-flop. The problem is that we all have multiple interests. For example, you might really like schizophrenia but at the same time you’re really interested in forensic psychology and the prison system. One semester you might want to study psychosis and the next semester you might become more interested in the prison system. Students can “flip flop” for a variety of reasons which can have two unfortunate consequences. First, you never get anything done. When you don’t get anything done then it’s hard to feel good about yourself and you make no progress. Second, continued indecisiveness could implicitly instill in the student a sense that they should always feel comfortable with their topic, that work on the thesis should always be easy and interesting, or that they might be “missing out” by not researching some other area of interest. In reality, none of these are true. One of the greatest challenges of doing research is developing the ability to consistently make small steps on a project even when the feeling is not there or other demands are present and taking up our time. It is likely that you’re lifestyle and habits will change when dedicated to research. You just work more (much, much, more). The thesis will not define you. Students should understand that the topic they select to study will not define their career. In this sense, the thesis topic itself is not really that important. What is more important is that students pick a topic so they can learn how to do competent research. You can’t do that if you don’t have a focused topic. In sum, it would be nice if you are passionate or, at minimum, interested in the topic but it simply is not necessary. Find an article that excites you. One way to find a topic is to choose an area of interest and read as many research articles in the subject that you can. In doing so, it will be easiest to read the introduction and discussion sections only. Diving into the method and results can sometimes be overwhelming and demoralizing. Once a student finds an article that excites them, they can consider the method and results section. A second important point here is that good science should include replication. An excellent thesis would be a replication study to see if the effects reported in prior work can be found again. We do not often do this in psychological science and our field suffers because of it. Due: October 1st, first year. "],
["open-science-framework.html", "2.2 Open Science Framework", " 2.2 Open Science Framework Creating a transparent and reproducible workflow OSF is a repository that allows researchers to transparently share their work with the larger scientific community. During the course of the program, students use OSF to organize their thesis and other independent research projects. Instructions for setting up an OSF project can be found here and will be reviewed with Dr. Bedics at students first advising meeting. In addition to organizing students’ workflow, OSF allows students to showcase their work to their peers and potential employers and doctoral advisors. Students in the thesis option are required to use OSF and it is strongly recommended for students completing the research project. Due: October 1st, first year. "],
["literature-review-timeline.html", "2.3 Literature Review Timeline", " 2.3 Literature Review Timeline Understanding the Problem The development of the literature review begins during the fall of the first year during PSYC 564 Advanced Research Methods. The literature review will become the “introduction” section of the final thesis paper. The literature review demonstrates the student’s mastery of the literature surrounding the problem to be addressed by the thesis. Initial drafts, such as that from PSYC 564, are 10-12 pages in length. The development of the literature review is, however, ongoing throughout the two years of the program until the final draft is submitted on May 1st of the second year. The typical length of a completed introduction section is between 20-40 pages long but there is no maximum length. In terms of content, students are encouraged to consider multiple perspectives in their work and also to integrate their thoughts related to culture and diversity regarding the topic area. The idea here is that a good understanding of a problem area involves a thorough understanding of the context. Context includes a consideration of the place, time, and people under study as well as the same characteristics of those who are doing the investigating. Due: December 15th, first year (First Major Draft); May 15th, end of first year (Second Major Draft with Hypotheses); May 1st, end of second year (Final Draft). "],
["method-section-timeline.html", "2.4 Method Section Timeline", " 2.4 Method Section Timeline Solving the Problem The method sections defines the procedures of the thesis. The method section consists of the participant selection, selection of methods of measurements or materials, the procedure and the data analytic method. The method section can be worked on in PSYC 552 Psychometrics during spring of the first year and also PSYC 562 Statistics II: Regression. The method section is finalized during PSYC 565 Research Practicum in the fall of the second year. Lastly, the method section should include a power analysis. The primary purpose of the power analysis is to provide students with the best understanding of the size of the sample needed to successfully test their hypothesis. In other words, students should never have to say in their discussion “The study was limited due to a small sample. Future research should include a larger sample size.” When authors make this statement they are basically stating that they ran a study where they can’t lose. If they find significance then great. If they don’t then they say “Oh well, we’re probably right but just need more people.” You should ask yourself, why would you run a test when you couldn’t reach a conclusion and when you basically say you “win” regardless. It makes no sense to run the study. The power analysis should be calculated during the summer or during PSYC 565 in the fall of the second year and prior to IRB submission.

Their roles are described below as is the process for finding and selecting committee members. Committee Chair The chair must have content knowledge of the area under investigation for the thesis. For example, if the thesis is on schizophrenia then the chair must have extensive knowledge of schizophrenia. The chair is either a part-time or full-time faculty member at CLU and is chosen with the approval of the Program Director, Dr. Bedics. There can be exceptions to the above criteria with the approval of Dr. Bedics.

["people.html", "Section 4 Thesis Committee", " Section 4 Thesis Committee Finding a Committee For many faculty, being on a thesis committee is a lot of work and they are often reluctant to agree to help students. Consequently, how students choose to approach faculty is very critical. Please consider these guidelines and talk to Dr. Bedics prior to reaching out to potential committee members. 1. Identifying Potential Faculty Search the CLU website for potential faculty that could contribute to your idea. Look at faculty interests in graduate psychology, undergraduate psychology, as well as other departments at CLU. Students could also identify faculty at other universities that might serve on the committee. Once identified, students should email Dr. Bedics to discuss. 2. Foot-in-the-Door Students first introduce themselves to faculty through email. Do not ask them to join your committee in the first email. Instead, ask them if they have time to answer questions about your project. If they don’t have time or incentive to do this then they will not be willing to be on your committee. The foot-in-the-door strategy also allows students to gain feedback from the person even if they are not willing to be on students’ committee. Here is a properly formatted and professional email using the foot-in-the-door strategy: Dear Dr. ###, My name is &lt;STUDENT&gt; and I am currently developing my master’s thesis project at California Lutheran University in the MS Clinical Psychology Program. The topic is &lt;TOPIC&gt;. I think your expertise in &lt;AREA&gt; would help me in thinking through some of the details of the thesis. I was curious if you could make time to answer a few questions over email or perhaps even chat over the phone or during your office hours? I have attached a brief summary of my project. Thank you for your time and consideration. Sincerely, First Name Last Name If they reply, and are positive, then you it is your responsibility to be flexible with your time. Also, please never ask for an appointment in the same week. 3. Requesting Committee Membership – If the initial meeting goes well then Dr. Bedics will email the faculty member to discuss the role of the chair and reader. 4. Working with your committee The committee will be most successful when students establish clear expectations for meeting with their committee members. Clearly established expectations will prevent you from emailing too little or too much. It is best to suggest fewer meetings, perhaps one at the beginning and one at the end of the semester. You will have more meetings with your chair than your reader. Establish the following: Make a clear statement that you are respectful of their time and do not want to meet too much or too little. Faculty often appreciate such direct and respectful statements. Suggest two meetings a semester and go from there. They might suggest more or a timeline based upon other criteria. "],
["coursework-relevant-to-the-thesis.html", "Section 5 Coursework Relevant to the Thesis", " Section 5 Coursework Relevant to the Thesis The knowledge gained from every course taken at CLU can be used to improve the development of the thesis. For example, if you have an interest in examining a specific disorder for your thesis then it makes sense that you study that disorder in PSYC 510 Psychopathology. In PSYC 560 Statistics I: Exploratory Data Analysis, you might consider finding open data that allows you to better understand your problem area through data visualization. There are, however, specific courses where the thesis is explicitly incorporated into course assignments. The following are the MSCP courses that explicitly incorporate elements of the thesis into the syllabi: PSYC# Course Semester Year Task 564 Adv. Research Methods Fall One Start Lit Review; Start References 562 Statistics II: Regression Spring One Data Analytic Plan 552 Psychometrics Spring One Method 521 Ethics Summer One Pre-Registration 565 Research Practicum Fall Two IRB, Intro, Method 566 Thesis Spring Two Complete Draft due May 1st 599 Thesis Continuation Every semester Post 2nd year Two+ Every semester until the thesis is complete PSYC 564 Advanced Research Methods In PSYC 564, students develop the beginning of their literature review and begin to master the 7th edition of the Publication Manual by the American Psychological Association (see formatting section). PSYC 562: Statistics II: Regression In this course, students learn the basics of statistical modeling with an emphasis on regression. Although the focus of the course is on regression, students can work with the instructor to consider models that might address their research hypotheses. If students have a published article that closely approximates the study they want to run then students might learn more about the analyses conducted in that article. PSYC 552: Psychometrics The emphasis on this course is psychometric theory which includes an understanding of the concepts of reliability and validity. Students can use this course to examining the psychometric properties of the most likely methods of measurement such as self-report questionnaires. PSYC 521: Clinical and Research Ethics In this course, students learn about the concept of open science which include reproducibility, transparency, and pre-registration. Students continue to develop their OSF page and learn how to pre-register their hypotheses. PSYC 565: Research Practicum In addition to finishing up their introduction and method sections, students main task is to complete the CLU IRB, https://www.callutheran.edu/research/irb/. The IRB process is very extensive and students are required to complete an online ethical training. Once the IRB is successfully passed, students can collect their data. The process of getting IRB approval can be a lengthy one and require several revisions. Students submit their IRB in collaboration with their committee chair who will submit the IRB proposal to the IRB committee on the student’s behalf. A critical part of the thesis is the power analysis. The power analysis determines whether or not the proposed study will be able to accomplish the proposed goals (i.e., adequately test the hypothesis(-es)). The most basic application of the power analysis is to determine the required sample size necessary to find the effect most likely to be achieved given prior work in the field. Students will complete a power analysis prior to submitting their IRB. PSYC 566: Thesis During this semester, students work independently on their thesis (with their committee members) and complete their results and discussion sections. The semester requires the student to structure their own time as their are no formal class meetings. Students are often collecting data during this final semester. In order to pass PSYC 566, students are required to have a complete draft of their thesis that is approved by the chair, reader, and program director. Students often do not complete thesis for a variety of reasons including an inability to collect data, medical and health problems, or other life priorities. In these circumstances, students have two options: 1. Continue the thesis - Students can choose to continue the thesis and enroll in PSYC 599, and pay the feel, every semester until the thesis is complete. Students are assigned the following grade for PSYC 566 until the thesis is approved: “IP” (In Progress) is given for theses, practica, internships and courses wherein the work has been evaluated and found to be satisfactory to date, but the assignment of a grade must await its completion. “IP” carries no credit until replaced by a permanent grade. The “IP” grade may be replaced by the appropriate final letter grade within one calendar year from the start of the class. “IP” grades which have not been resolved will be changed to “F” (undergraduate) or “NC” (graduate) at the time the student’s degree is posted. 2. Drop the Thesis and take the Comprehensive Exam - Students can register for the comprehensive exam and pay the associated fee. The comprehensive exam is offered every semester and should be taken the first semester the student does not register for PSYC 599. PSYC 599: Thesis Continuation Students who do not complete the thesis by the end of their second year and choose to continue to work on thesis must register for PSYC 599 every semester until the thesis is approved.

A good example is Southworth Fine Business Paper, 25% cotton, 24 pound, white, stock #403C which is available for purchase from Office Depot, OfficeMax, and Staples. A similar 20 pound weight paper is also available. Original signed signature pages on the same paper must be submitted with each of the three copies. Additional personal copies may be ordered at the same time. Personal copies may be printed on paper of the student’s choice (e.g., 20 pound paper). Signature pages for the personal copies may be photocopies of the originals as long as they are on paper that is identical to the rest of the thesis. Copies for binding must be delivered to the Program Specialist. The copies delivered to the Program Specialist are NOT to be bound - just packaged with bright colored paper separating the individual copies. Students are responsible for paying binding fees for all copies (the three required copies and for any additional personal copies). The cost is $40 per copy (no matter the length), and to be paid by check to CLU. Prices may change. The Program Specialist will forward the copies to the bindery as they are delivered. Once the Program Specialist receives the copies and payment for binding, a change of grade will be submitted to the Registrar’s Office. The bound copies are typically ready in about 6-8 weeks and are distributed as follows: The Graduate School of Psychology copy and the Thesis Committee Chair copy will be delivered via campus mail by the Program Specialist. Students will be notified when their personal copies are ready for pick-up. If you have any questions regarding the binding process, please do not hesitate to contact Mengmeng Liu, Graduate Program Specialist, at 805-493-3662 or at mengmengliu@callutheran.edu. The pricing is subject to change based on bindery costs.↩ "],

Integrity Academic dishonesty diminishes the quality of scholarship and defrauds those who depend upon the integrity of the educational system. Consult the CLU Graduate Catalog for definitions of cheating, fabrication, facilitating academic dishonesty, and plagiarism. According to university policy, students who engage in academic dishonesty may be in jeopardy of disciplinary action, including suspension or expulsion from the university. Failure to Complete the Thesis Many students are unable to complete the thesis within the expected two years of study. Students who do not successfully complete the thesis within the first two years are required to maintain continuous enrollment by registering for PSYC 599C-01 Thesis Continuation every semester until the thesis is successfully completed. Under special circumstances, students can take a leave of absence from the university. Such a leave of absence is completed in accordance with university policies which can be found through the university registrar. "],
