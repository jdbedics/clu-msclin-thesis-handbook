# Coursework Relevant to the Thesis


Technically, the knowledge students gain from each course can be used to improve the development of the thesis. For example, if you have a particular interest in a specific disorder then it makes sense that you study that disorder in *PSYC 510 Psychopathology*. 

There are, however, specific courses where the thesis is explicitly incorporated into assignments.  Here are MSCP courses and how they are used to support the thesis: 



|PSYC#| Course           | Semester | Year | Task |
