# Thesis Committee

**Finding a Committee**

For many faculty, being on a thesis committee is a lot of work and they are often reluctant to join a committee. Consequently, how you approach faculty is very critical to your success. Dr. Bedics will walk you through much of the process. 

___

**1. Identifying Potential Faculty**

Search the CLU website for potential faculty that could contribute to your idea.  Look at faculty interests in graduate psychology, undergraduate psychology, as well as other departments at CLU.  You could also identify faculty at other universities that might serve on the committee.  Once you identify potential committee members, please email Dr. Bedics to review.

**2.	Foot-in-the-Door** 

You will first introduce yourself to faculty through email.  **Do not ask them to join your committee** in your first email.  Instead, ask them if they have time to answer questions about your project. If they don't have time or incentive to do this simple task then they will not be willing to be on your committee. The foot-in-the-door strategy also allows you to get some feedback even if they are not willing to be on your committee.  

Here is a properly formatted and professional email using the foot-in-the-door strategy:

```
Dear Dr. ###,

My name is STUDENT and I am currently developing my master’s thesis project at California Lutheran University in the MS Clinical Psychology Program.  The topic is on <TOPIC>. I think your expertise in <AREA> would help me in thinking through some of the details of my project.  I was curious if you could make time to answer a few questions over email or perhaps even chat over the phone or during your office hours?  I have attached a brief summary of my project.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

First Name Last Name
```

If they reply, and our positive, then you it is your responsibility to be flexible with *your* time.  Also, never ask for an appointment in the same week.

**3.	Requesting Committee Membership** – If the initial meeting goes well then Dr. Bedics will email the faculty member to discuss the role of the chair and reader.  

## Working with your committee

The committee will be most successful if you establish clear expectations of when you will talk or email with each other.  Clearly established expectations will prevent you from emailing *too little* or *too much*. Establish the following:
  
  * Make a clear statement that you would like to be mindful of their time and not approach them too much nor too little.
  
  * How often would they like to look at your work?
  
  * How often would they like to talk/video conference?

It is best to suggest *fewer* meetings, perhaps one at the beginning and one at the end of the semester. You will have more meetings with your chair than your reader.
